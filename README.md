## Go-Library
#### This repo is is boiler place repo for creating a Library Management System using Golang.
#### This basic idea suffers from some aspects such as
    There is no associated structure especially the database quering part
    BSON to JSON conversion is not handled properly
    Functions haven't been defined properly

#### I plan to create a better version with easier conversion and structure approach.
##### PS the Front end is also missing
